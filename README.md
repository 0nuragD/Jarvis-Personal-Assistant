# Jarvis Personal Assistant

## Project Overview
Jarvis Personal Assistant is an advanced virtual assistant designed to streamline daily tasks and enhance productivity through voice commands. Inspired by popular AI assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, Jarvis combines speech recognition, natural language processing, and various web services to provide a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

- **Voice Interaction:**
  - Utilizes `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` for converting speech to text and text to speech, respectively.
  - Supports dynamic and real-time interaction with users through voice commands.

- **Web Navigation:**
  - Integrates with `webbrowser` to open popular websites such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn upon user request.

- **Music Playback:**
  - Connects to a custom `musicLibrary` to search and play songs directly from the web.

- **News Updates:**
  - Fetches the latest news headlines using the NewsAPI, delivering up-to-date information through audible summaries.

- **AI-Driven Responses:**
  - Leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT model for handling general queries and providing intelligent, context-aware responses.

- **Speech Output:**
  - Uses `gTTS` and `pygame` for generating and playing speech output, ensuring high-quality and natural-sounding responses.

## Technical Stack

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, `speech_recognition`, `webbrowser`, `pyttsx3`, `requests`, `gTTS`, `pygame`.
- **APIs:** NewsAPI for fetching news, OpenAI for intelligent responses.
- **Hardware Requirements:** Microphone for voice input.


## Future Enhancements

- Expanding the range of supported commands and services.
- Improving natural language understanding and response accuracy.
- Integrating with smart home devices for broader functionality.
